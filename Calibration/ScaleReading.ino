 Example using the SparkFun HX711 breakout board with a scale

 This example demonstrates basic scale output. See the calibration sketch to get the calibration_factor for your
 specific load cell setup.
 
 This example code uses bogde's excellent library: https://github.com/bogde/HX711

 The HX711 does one thing well: read load cells. The breakout board is compatible with any wheat-stone bridge
 based load cell which should allow a user to measure everything from a few grams to tens of tons.

 Arduino pin 2 -> HX711 CLK
 3 -> DAT
 5V -> VCC
 GND -> GND
 
 The HX711 board can be powered from 2.7V to 5V so the Arduino 5V power should be fine.


 [Works with the SerialComm script. The arduino needs to be started and streaming data, but the serial-output has to be closed on the IDE for this to be transmitted to the python script.
