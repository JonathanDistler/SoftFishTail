### Soft Fish Tail
This is a sub-project for the ETH Zurich SRL (Soft Robotics Laboratory). As part of the project, I was tasked with optimizing a soft-robotic tail for force-output and fish manuevarability. As a side project, I tasked myself with designing a program that would iterate over different tail dimensions (as well as materials), to help select a tail with a user-specific radius-of-curvature.
